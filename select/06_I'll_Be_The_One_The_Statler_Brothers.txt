(I'll be the one)
The one standing in the shadows
When you think the world has been unfair

(I'll be the one)
The one walking beside you
When no one else is there

(I'll be the one)
The one to hear all your stories
All your pleasures, all your regrets

(I'll be the one)
The one who never remembers
The things you want to forget

I'll be the pillow you lie on
I'll be your midnight lullaby
I'll be the shade on your window
To keep the stars from your eyes

(I'll be the one)
The one who'll always forgive you
No matter what you've done

(I'll be the one)
You just need someone to hold you
You know I'll be the one

I'll be the pillow you lie on
I'll be your midnight lullaby
I'll be the shade on your window
To keep the stars from your eyes

(I'll be the one)
The one who'll always forgive you
No matter what you've done

(I'll be the one)
You just need someone to hold you
You know I'll be the one
