Holding out for the one
Holding out for the one

Another party, another late crowd
We got the music turned up all the way loud
Another "hey girl", another lean-in
Another "here we go, welcome to the weekend"

"Hey baby, what you drinkin'?"
Like I don't know what you're thinking
Same damn lines every time

All the boys say "Hey, take a ride with me
Oh, pretty little thing, stay the night with me"
I say, "Hey, I don't think you understand
I'm not the girl with her high heels in her hand"
In last night's little black party dress
Yeah, maybe I'm a little bit different, I guess
But ain't giving my heart to just anyone
I'm holding out for the one

Holding out for the one
I'm holding out for the one
Holding out for the one

I'm gonna know when I feel it
Yeah, he's gonna give me somethin' to believe in
Won't have to tell me, he's gonna show me
He's gonna take his sweet time to get to know me, mmm
I know he's out there somewhere, and he gets me too

When the boys say "Hey, take a ride with me
Oh, pretty little thing, stay the night with me"
I say, "Hey, I don't think you understand
I'm not the girl with her high heels in her hand"
In last night's little black party dress
Yeah, maybe I'm a little bit different, I guess
But ain't giving my heart to just anyone, no
I'm holding out for the one

Holding out for the one
I'm holding out for the one
Holding out for the one
I'm holding out, yeah

Ooh
Hey, hey

"Hey baby, what you drinkin'?"
Like I don't know what you're thinking
Same damn lines every time

All the boys say "Hey, take a ride with me
Pretty little thing, stay the night with me"
I say, "Hey, I don't think you understand
I'm not the girl with her high heels in her hand"
In last night's little black party dress
Yeah, maybe I'm a little bit different I guess
But ain't giving my heart to just anyone
I'm holding out for the one

Holding out for the one
I'm holding out for the one
Holding out for the one
Oh, oh, I'm holding out for the one
Holding out for the one

(Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah) Holding out for the one
I'm holding out for the one
